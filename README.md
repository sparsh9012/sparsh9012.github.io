# Overview

Object Detection is a Computer Vision problem which deals with identifying and locating object of certain classes in the image.

### Approaches

**Two-Step Object Detection** involves algorithms that first identify bounding boxes which may potentially contain objects and then classify each bounding separately.

**One-Step Object Detection**

**Heatmap-based object detection** can be, in some sense, considered an extension of one-shot based Object Detection. While one-shot based object detection algorithms try to directly regress the bounding box coordinates (or offsets), heatmap-based object detection provides probability distribution of bounding box corners/center.

### Evaluation metrics

**Average Precision and Average Recall :** ****Precision meditates how accurate are our predictions while recall accounts for whether we are able to detect all objects present in the image or not. Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR) are two common metrics used for object detection.

## Project ideas

* Counting - How many people present in the class
* Visual search engine - Finding similar purses ([link](https://labs.pinterest.com/assets/paper/visual_search_at_pinterest.pdf))
